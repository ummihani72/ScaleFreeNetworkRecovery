# scalefreenetworkrecovery
This project studies scale free networks and its recovery during intentional attacks. 
Intentional attacks refer to the removal of some of the largest hubs. First a scale free network 
is created using the B-A algorithm. Then, an intentional attack simulation is executed. Finally, 
run the recovery simulation. Start with main.m to understand the order of calling each functions.
Each file is equipped with further explanation of its purpose, input and output parameters.

This project has 2 types of intentional attack simulations
1. Initial Degree
2. Recalculated Degree

This project has 4 recovery simulations
1. Global-global recovery
2. Neighbour-global recovery
3. Neighbour-neighbour recovery
4. Neighbour-2 hop recovery
